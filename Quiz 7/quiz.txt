1. Write an SML function to find the minimum and maximum elements in a list. Example: minMax [4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 2, 1, 8] returns (1, 9). The program should only iterate once over the elements (i.e., compute the min and max at the same time)

2. Longest Sublist Without Repeating Elements: Write an SML function that given a list, finds the length of the longest sublist without repeating elements. Example: longestSubList [1,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,6], the length answer is 6 because [1,2,3,4,5,6] is the longest sublist without repeating elements.
