1. The binding time in C of:
a. The number of built-in functions (standard library, math, type queries, sizeof, printf, malloc, assert, etc.) is bound:

b. The variable declaration that corresponds to a particular variable reference is bound at:

c. The maximum length allowed for a constant (literal) character string (if there is a limit) is bound at:

d. The address of a particular library routine is bound by:

e. The total amount of space occupied by program code and data is bound at:

2. Give an example of when a variable may be live but not in scope:

3. Consider the following Psuedocode:
procedure P(A, B : real)
	X : real
	procedure Q(B, C : real)
		Y : real
		...
	procedure R(A, C : real)
		Z : real
		- (*)

What is the referencing enviroment at the location marked by (*) with static scope?

4. Consider the following program:

var total = 0
def a():
	total += 1
def b(F):
	var total = 0
	F()
	print "B", total
def c():
	var total = 0
	b(a)
	print "C", total
c()
print "T", total

What is the output with:
- Static Scoping:

- Dynamic Scoping with Shallow Binding:

- Dynamic Scoping with Deep Binding:
